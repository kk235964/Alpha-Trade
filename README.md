Due to the unavailability of a KYC-verified API key, all data is currently mock-generated.

## üîê About API Usage

The app is built to support **live data from CoinDCX APIs**. However, due to the unavailability of a verified KYC API key, mock data is used for dashboard graphs and analytics. The switch component allows toggling between real and mock data for smooth testing and presentation.
